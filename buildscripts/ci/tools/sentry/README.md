# Crash dumps

## Capturing

Crashes are captured by [Crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/README.md).
The client is part of the Diagnostics module and starts a `crashpad_handler`
process at startup (see `DiagnosticsModule::onInit`); the handler snapshots the
crashing process, writes a minidump next to the logs, and — if the user agreed
to send crash reports — uploads it to Sentry.

## Debug files

A minidump on its own is a list of addresses. Turning it into a readable stack
needs two kinds of information, which on most platforms live in two files:

| | debug info (functions, files, lines) | unwind info (walking the stack) |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `mscore.dSYM` | `mscore` |
| Windows | `MuseScore4.pdb` | `MuseScore4.exe` |
| Linux | the unstripped binary | the same binary |

CI uploads these to Sentry in the `Upload debug files` step, which runs
`buildscripts/ci/tools/sentry/upload_debug_files.cmake`. Sentry reads the formats
directly, so nothing is converted along the way.

Two things to know:

- Only **stable** builds upload debug files. Nightly builds still report
  crashes, but those reports stay unsymbolicated.
- On macOS the DWARF stays in the object files, so a separate `dsymutil` step
  (`buildscripts/ci/macos/generate_dsym.cmake`) collects it into a dSYM before
  packaging, while the object files and the debug map are still around.

Debug files must match the build the dump came from. They are matched by debug
id — `LC_UUID` on macOS, the PDB GUID on Windows, the build id on Linux — which
survives stripping and signing, so the files collected during the build stay
valid for what ships.

## Reading a dump online

Reading a dump by hand means collecting the right debug files first, so it is
usually less work to let Sentry do the symbolication: drop the `.dmp` (they sit
in `logs/dumps/completed` next to the logs) on
<https://musescore.github.io/dumps/>, give it the server, the project and the
same `sentry_key` the build posts with, and it links the event Sentry makes of
it. Handy for a dump that never got sent — a local build, a file a user passed
along, or a session where the crash report was declined.

It uploads rather than looks up, so the dump becomes a *new* event: one the app
already sent will be in Sentry twice, and the stack is only readable if debug
files for that build are there. The page runs entirely in the browser and keeps
the key on that device.

## Reading a dump locally

Get the debug files for that exact build from Sentry first:
**Project Settings → Debug Files**, search by the debug id from the report.

**macOS** — LLDB reads minidumps natively:

```sh
lldb --core crash.dmp MuseScore\ 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore
(lldb) add-dsym /path/to/mscore.dSYM
(lldb) bt all
```

**Windows** — open the dump in WinDbg and point it at the PDB:

```
.sympath+ C:\path\to\symbols
.reload /f
!analyze -v
```

**Linux** — there is no comparable native viewer; read the report in Sentry.

To see what a debug file actually contains before trusting it:

```sh
sentry-cli debug-files check /path/to/file
```
