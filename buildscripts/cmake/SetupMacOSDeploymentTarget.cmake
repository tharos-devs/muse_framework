# CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, and already uses it for the compiler checks it performs.
#
# The default set here can be overridden by specifying CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET on the
# command line or in a CMake preset, or by setting the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment
# variable, which CMake picks up by itself.

# If the variable is not set by the time `project()` runs, CMake creates an empty cache entry
# for it; FORCE makes sure that such an empty value is replaced by the default below.
